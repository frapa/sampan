Fix panorama pictures from Samsung phones. These pictures are not standard JPEG
and cannot be opened by most programs. They're also unnecessary large due to
the embedded video file.

The program is also capable or removing the motion video from pictures taken
with Samsung phones and of removing similar videos from wide selfies.

Typically, it reduces the file size in about half, without any loss of picture
quality.
